3D Maze Runner Game
---

The aim of this game is to find the exit (marked as a red square in the floor) of a maze in the lowest time possible. You may find some suprises (such as a zombie) in the way out, which you will have to eliminate. The mazes will become bigger and more complicated as you pass along levels. Be aware of the timeout!
